* Klutshnik CLI Frontend

Klutshnik is a system which **encrypts data-at-rest**: backups, files, and archives.

Yawn. Even PGP or Age can do that. Yes, but can they rotate keys without decrypting terabytes of data? Can they share your key across multiple servers so it *never* exists in one place? Can they guarantee that if your key is stolen today, the thief can't decrypt backups from yesterday (Forward Secrecy) or tomorrow (Post-Compromise Security)? No.

Klutshnik:
 - is self-hosted and free software,
 - compartments your keys from your plaintext,
 - supports running on small microcontrollers,
 - stores absolutely no private data.

This package provides the CLI client for this system. For more information, please
see the man page at https://klutshnik.info/manpages/klutshnik.html
