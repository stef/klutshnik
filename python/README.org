* klutshnik cli frontend

Klutshnik is a system which encrypts data-at-rest: backups, files,
archives - for you or your group. Yawn, even PGP^WAge can do
that. Yes, but it cannot do regular key updates on an untrusted
storage, providing post-compromise security (PCS) or forward secrecy
(FS). And the best part is, the encryption key is shared in a
threshold setup, and never ever assembled, so chances of accidental
leakage are 0.

This package provides the CLI client for this system. For more information, pls
see the man page at https://klutshnik.info/manpages/klutshnik.html
