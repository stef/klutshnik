# Verifiable Threshold Updatable Oblivious Key Management for Storage Systems

This is a PoC implementing the full VTUOKMS from

https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1275
"Updatable Oblivious Key Management for Storage Systems"
by Stanislaw Jarecki, Hugo Krawczyk, and Jason Resch

OK, tl;dr, wth is a vtuokms???5? To quote the above paper's abstract:

> [...] system, that builds on Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions
> (OPRF), hides keys and object identifiers from the KMS, offers
> unconditional security for key transport, provides key
> verifiability, reduces storage, and more. Further, we show how to
> provide all these features in a distributed threshold implementation
> that enhances protection against server compromise.

> We extend this system with updatable encryption capability that
> supports key updates (known as key rotation) so that upon the
> periodic change of OPRF keys by the KMS server, a very efficient
> update procedure allows a client of the KMS service to
> non-interactively update all its encrypted data to be decryptable
> only by the new key. This enhances security with forward and
> post-compromise security, namely, security against future and past
> compromises, respectively, of the clientâ€™s OPRF keys held by the
> KMS. Additionally, and in contrast to tra- ditional KMS, our
> solution supports public key encryption and dispenses with any
> interaction with the KMS for data encryption (only decryption by the
> client requires such communication).

One thing that is missing from the above, is the "V" in "VTUOKMS"
which:

> provides verifiability, namely, the ability of KmS to prove to C
> that the [calculated en/decryption key] is indeed the value that
> results from computing the OPRF on the client-provided object
> identifier. This prevents data loss that occurs if the [calculated
> en/decryption key] is wrong (either due to computing error or to
> adversarial action)

# dependencies

This code depends on liboprf[1], libsodium[2], pysodium[3], noise-c[4] and dissononce[5].

It is to be expected that the dependencies noise-c and dissononce will
be eliminated by specific implementation of the Noise XK handshake
using libsodium.

# Building

You need to install libsodium-dev, dissononce and pysodium, with
whatever tools your OS provides you with.

## liboprf

```
# in directory $buildroot
git clone https://github.com/stef/liboprf/
cd liboprf
# have a look in the makefile to be sure you trust the next step with root permissions
make install
cp liboprf.so /usr/lib # or wherever your OS stores libs
# on glibc based systems also run:
# ldconfig
# go back to $buildroot
cd ..
```

## build tuokms

```
# in directory $buildroot

git clone https://github.com/stef/tuokms/
cd tuokms
git clone https://github.com/rweather/noise-c
cd noise-c
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-libsodium --with-openssl
make
cd ..
make
```

## testing

In order to test also the update of keys, a minimum of
`2*(threshold-1)+1` shares is necessary. Hence the minimim setup
requires 5 servers (possibly the number is 3 actually, this needs
testing/confirmation). for them we need to create each their own
keypair using:

```
for i in $(seq 0 4); do ./genkey.py ksm$i.key; done
```

The public keys printed to standard output from above must be set
accordingly in the file `tuokms.cfg`

We also need to create a client key:

```
./genkey.py client.tmp | base64 -d >>client.tmp
base64 <client.tmp >client.key
rm client.tmp
```

Some directories need to be created. The default `keys/` can be
changed in `tuokms.cfg` is used by the client to store its public
keys:

```
mkdir keys
```

and `shares` is hardcoded and relative where the kms server is
running. This directory is used by the kms to store the shares:

```
mkdir shares
```

Finally you can start the servers, a simple script `start-servers.sh`
is provided which starts 5 servers on localhost with the keys
generated before.

You can now try to run the commands from the:

# example session

```

# File formats

Encrypted files have the following structure:

```
16 bytes keyid
32 bytes w value
24 bytes nonce
n bytes ciphertext (chacha20)
16 bytes MAC (poly1305)
```

You can see in the above example session, that after key-update only
the w value is changed, nothing else.

Public keys saved by the client in the directory `keys`, are named
with their keyid. Their contents has the following structure:

```
1 byte threshold
32 bytes ristretto255 public key
```

Shares stored by the KMS in the `shares` folder are named
`<keyid>-<share-sequence-number>` their contents has the following
structure:

```
1 byte index
32 bytes share
```
